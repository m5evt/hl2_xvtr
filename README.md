Hermes-Lite 2 transverter companion card

Designed with the same footprint as the N2ADR filter board, this companion card is to be coupled to the Hermes-Lite 2 SDR transceiver. The transverter clock is designed to be sourced from the HL2 clock outputs. Power output is around 20 dBm and an amplifier will need to be used with this. 

The design has been built and tested on both 6m and 2m.
